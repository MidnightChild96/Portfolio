                    Greetings user! You are here looking on how to build your first computer or even may already be in the middle of the process.
                    These few webpages will give you the necessary information on what is necessary to build a computer. This page specifically will
                    inform you of the general purpose of each part, but will not go into specific details as the complex workings of a computer is not
                    necessary to assemble a computer. It is important though to understand why it is necessary to have it in a computer, and we will discuss 
                    that as part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part we will discuss is the Central Processing Unit also known as the CPU. This is arguably the most important part in your build 
                    as it acts as the brain of your computer. As the name implies it will process information ranging from interpreting your keyboard inputs to 
                    rendering a video or audio file. The CPU is a powerful multipurpose tool that is necessary for every computer. It is important to choose a CPU 
                    that can handle your workload otherwise even your newly built computer will act sluggish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next part is the motherboard which can be considered the home for all the parts as each of them connects to the motherboard and interacts 
                    with the other parts that way. The motherboard has evolved throughout the years, but the most important attribute is that the motherboard has 
                    a chipset that can interact with your CPU. The chipset can be thought of as a translator and each CPU can speak its own language. Without a compatible 
                    chipset the CPU will not work. Otherwise other features are up to the consumer such as wi-fi compatibility, the RAM speed support, usb ports, RGB, and so on. 
                    Otherwise motherboards tend to be versatile in this area except the chipset.

                    RAM is the next piece we will discuss about and it is not a complicated piece of hardware to understand. The simplified explanation of its job 
                    allows users to neglect the piece, but the RAM is important. RAM holds temporary memory that the processor will use at a later point in time. It 
                    can be thought of as a supporting piece of the CPU. While this is accurate, the RAM has important role as the CPU does not have a whole lot of memory 
                    space to temporarily store data. RAM also cannot be thought of as storage as RAM has a much higher processing speed that a hard drive or even a solid state 
                    drive. The only issue is that RAM can only store information while it powered therefore the moment it loses power it will lose all that data and it also rather 
                    expensive costwise to use RAM architecture to store data in large quantities. Therefore RAM is used to temporarily store data that the CPU will need in the near 
                    future. It is important that the RAM speed is fast enough to send data to the processor otherwise there will be noticeable latencies when interacting with programs 
                    on your computer. It is also equally important the computer has enough RAM storage as data will be bottlenecked also slowing down processing speeds or the program 
                    may not even work.
                </p>

                    Storage is a part that most individuals will understand how it works. Storage on a computer simplies stores data for long term usage such as programs and files. Storage comes 
                    in vary sizes, but typically 256GB hard drive is large enough just to hold the operating system only. 500GB storage has become an accepted standard, but many users will find 
                    that size simply too small as programs have become larger than they were a decade ago. I personally would recommend having a minimum storage of at least 1TB either hard disk or solid state as that gives enough 
                    space for videos, photos, and a decent amount of games. You may be wondering what the difference between hard disk and solid state is? Without getting too deep into details hard disk is a physical 
                    disk that stores your data. It is cheaper to produce therefore it is typically more cost-effective to buy hard disk drive for the same amount of storage. The advantage of a solid state drive is that there 
                    are no moving parts in the system therefore there are no moving parts to deal with allowing for quicker data transferrence. The lack of moving parts also means there is no degradation due to 
                    parts interacting with each other allowing for a much longer lifespan as well. Both hard disk and solid disk drives can exist in the same computer and many people do have hybrid builds as 
                    having a solid disk has noticeable speeds such as starting up a computer while the hard disk is often used to store large or files not oftenly accessed by the user.

                    The graphics card is the most important part to the build for a gamer and those who require graphical details such as virtual simulation. For an everyday user a graphics card is not 
                    as important as many CPUs have built in GPUs therefore bypassing the need for a graphics card. Unfortunately those GPUs are not very powerful and will not handle programs 
                    that require intensive graphics. Video games most noticeably require a lot of graphical processing power. There are many types of graphics cards out there and it is important for the 
                    user to choose the graphics card that will be able to handle the necessary task. Graphics cards tend to be the most expensive part in a computer due to the required processing power needed 
                    to process graphics. It is important to budget out a graphics card and a CPU as these two parts will set the consumer back hundreds of dollars. Although the function is not that complicated, 
                    the technology used to make a graphics card is complex and equally expensive.

                    The power supply is as simple as it gets. It is piece that will supply the whole system with power allowing the computer to turn on. Power supplies do come in a few varieties such as modular, semi-modular,
                    and non-modular. Those simply implies the cables that connect to the other parts. Modular implies that the cables are adjustable according to what parts you have such as not all computers have a graphics card, 
                    therefore a cable connecting power to the graphics card is not necessary. Semi-modular implies that only some of the cables are modular while non-modular implies that the cables are not adjustable and must be hidden 
                    if not being used. It is important that the computer has enough of a power to supply the system with power otherwise the system will not even turn on. If you plan on upgrading in the future it is also important 
                    that you plan ahead and obtain a power supply with enough power to handle the upgrade.

                    Finally the case itself is the most customizable piece in the whole computer. There is very few important aspects in a computer case that a user needs to be aware of as it primarily comes down their preference. 
                    The only thing that a consumer needs to be aware of is that the case can hold the motherboard as motherbaords come in a few differing sizes such as ATX and micro ATX. Otherwise cases come in a large variety such 
                    as tempered glass side panels, differing amount of usb ports, colors, RGB, and so forth. It is the most visual part of the computer therefore if it is important to you then choose a case that suits your style.
